            <p>🌊 <strong>97.5%</strong> of Earth's water is salty and not suitable for human use. The remaining <strong>2.5%</strong> is mostly locked in ice caps!</p>
            <p>We rely on a tiny portion of fresh water for survival. It's crucial to keep our water sources clean and avoid wastage.</p>
            <p>From drinking and washing to farming and industry, water is essential for everything. Pollution and overuse are threatening this valuable resource.</p>

            <h2>🌱 Save Water, Save Our Planet</h2>
            <p>Our freshwater comes from rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, but climate change and pollution are causing water shortages worldwide.</p>
            <p><strong>🌍 Climate change</strong> is one of the biggest reasons for water scarcity. If we don’t act now, by 2050, many regions could run out of fresh water.</p>
            <p>Pollutants like sewage, industrial waste, and agricultural runoff are making our rivers and lakes undrinkable.</p>

                <p>Every minute you spend in a power shower uses up to 17 litres of water. Keep your showers short, sweet and water-saving.</p>

        <h2>4. Call for a new law</h2>
        <p>We can each do our small bit to save water at home, but we need to be able to hold polluters accountable for damaging our rivers, lakes, and seas.</p>
        <p>In 2023, sewage was poured into the UK's waterways 1,000 times a day.</p>
        <p>Friends of the Earth is calling for a new law that would force polluters to clean up their act: the Right to a Healthy Environment.</p>
